           <p> All plants and animals need water to survive.  </p>
           <p> There can be no life on earth without water. </p>
       <h1> Why is water so important? </h1>
           <p> Because 60 percent of our body weight is made up of water. Our bodies use water in all the cells, organs, and tissues, to help regulate body temperature and maintain other bodily functions. Because our bodies lose water through breathing, sweating, and digestion, it's crucial to rehydrate and replace water by drinking fluids and eating foods that contain water. </p>
        <li><h1> Water protects the tissues, spinal cord, and joints </h1></li>
            <p> Water  helps lubricate and cushion our joints, spinal cord, and tissues. This helps us to be more physically active, and reduces the discomfort caused by conditions such as arthritis. </p>
        <li><h1> Water prevents overall dehydration </h1></li>
            <p> Dehydration is the result of the body being deprived of adequate water. And,  since water is critical for the successful functioning of many bodily functions, dehydration can be very dangerous. </p>
        <li><h1> Water helps by creating saliva </h1></li>
            <p> Water is the main component of saliva. Itâ€™s critical for breaking down solid food and keeping your mouth healthy. If you find your mouth is drier than usual, increase your water intake. </p>
        <li><h1> Water aids cognitive functions </h1></li>
            <p> Proper hydration is crucial to staying in good cognitive shape. Research has shown that inadequate water intake can negatively impact our focus, alertness, and short-term memory. </p>
