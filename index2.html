        <h2><i> Importance of Cleanliness in Our Surroundings </i></h2>
            <p class="ad" >
            your surroundings have a big role to play in your wellbeing and wellness. Think of people who work in an area where their surroundings are not safe. Miners have high rates of lung disease, for example, because they are continuously breathing in poisonous coal dust. Over time, their surroundings contribute to sickness and sometimes even death. Itâ€™s not shocking that the bulk of your day is going to have an effect on health and wellness. </p>
        <h3><i> Importance of Cleanliness in Schools </i></h3>
            <p class="sd">
            Schools are also a crucial field when it comes to their surroundings. There are also cleanliness problems that both teachers and students face on a regular basis. One of the main reasons for this is that a clean school provides a healthier learning environment. The classroom, which is messy and dirty, has a poor reputation but can also confuse students who need to concentrate on their studies. Students can also learn information about their community and learn lessons from school stays.Academic quality also depends on the climate of the school. </p>
        <h4><i> Importance of Cleanliness For a Student </i></h4>
            <p class="ad">
            Students should also pay attention to their personal belonging and to the cleanness of their hygiene. For example, the things they bring around schools may lead to poor health. Wearing the same dirty stuff or wearing a dirty bag can make them sick over time. Similarly, if they contract a disease, they should take precautions to stay away from others until they have fully healed so as not to infect other students. For example, students are not always careful about keeping their areas clean. </p>
